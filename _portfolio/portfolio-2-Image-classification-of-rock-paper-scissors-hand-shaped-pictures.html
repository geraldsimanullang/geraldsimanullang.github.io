Hey everyone! This project is the final assignment for my Dicoding machine learning course. We had to make a smart thing using TensorFlow and Keras - a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). What does it do? It looks at hand pictures and decides if it's showing rock, paper, or scissors. Cool part? Got a perfect 5/5 for it. <br/><br/>

Now, let's get into the project! ðŸš€<br/><br/>

This work was done in <b>Google Colab</b>.
