Hey everyone! This project is the final assignment for my Dicoding machine learning course. 
We had to make a smart thing using TensorFlow and Keras - a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
What does it do? It looks at hand pictures and decides if it's showing rock, paper, or scissors. Cool part? 
Got a perfect 5/5 for it. <br/><br/>

Here are the requirements for this task: <br/>
<ul>
    <li><b>No Plagiarism!</b></li>
    <li>The dataset must be divided into a train set and a validation set.</li>
    <li>Image augmentation must be implemented.</li>
    <li>Utilize an image data generator.</li>
    <li>The model must be implemented using the sequential model.</li>
    <li>Model training should not exceed 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>The program is to be executed on Google Colaboratory.</li>
    <li>The model's accuracy should be a minimum of 85%.</li>
    <li>It should be capable of predicting images uploaded to Colab.</li>
</ul> <br/>

Criteria for Achieving a 5/5 Rating:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>All requirements must be fulfilled.</li>
    <li>Accuracy above 96%.</li>
    <li>Utilize three or more techniques not covered in the module.</li>
</ul>

Now, let's get into the project! ðŸš€<br/><br/>
