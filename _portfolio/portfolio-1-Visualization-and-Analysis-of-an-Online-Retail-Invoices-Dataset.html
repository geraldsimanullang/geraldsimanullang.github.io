In this project I conducted **visualization** and **analysis** on an online retail transaction dataset. 

The data I used is sourced from <b>UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</b> and is referred to as the "<b>Online-retail</b>" dataset.  
You can access this dataset here --> [Data Source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)  
The analysis was performed using **Jupyter Notebook**. To view the complete code, please click here --> [Complete Code](https://github.com/geraldsimanullang/Online-Retail-Invoices-Visualization-Analysis/blob/main/Online%20Retail%20Invoices%20Analysis.ipynb)

Now, let's begin.

## Dataset Information

First, let's take a look to the top 5 rows of the dataset:

  ```python
  df.head()
  ```

</p>

These are description of the dataset's columns obtained from data source:  
| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **InvoiceNo** | Invoice number, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction.|
| **StockCode** | Product (item), a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.|
| **Description** | Product (item) name.|
| **Quantity** | The quantities of each product (item) per transaction.  |
| **InvoiceDate** | Invoice Date and time, the day and time when each transaction was generated.|
| **UnitPrice** | Unit price, Product price per unit in sterling.|
| **CustomerID** | Customer number, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.|
| **Country** | Country name, the name of the country where each customer resides.|  
<br/>

This is basic information about the dataset:

**Dataset information summary:**  
1. Dataset contains 541909 rows data with 8 columns
2. **CustomerID** column has missing values
3. 


## Data Preprocessing
Before performing visualization and analysis, this dataset needs to be preprocessed first. The preprocessing processes include:  
1. Handling non-positive value in Quantity and Unitprice value
2. Handling Description ambiguity for every StockCode
3. Converting InvoiceDate data type
