Hi there, I'm Gerald! üëãüèª Welcome to my personal portfolio page. üôèüèª <br/>
Below are my portfolios divided into two categories.<br/>

<h3>Data Analysis and Visualization</h3>
Gain insights and create visualization card and dashboard from large dataset.

  <li><a href="https://geraldsimanullang.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-of-Pizza-Sales-SQL-PowerBI/" target="_blank">Data Analysis and Visualization of Pizza Sales</a><br/>
    Tools: SQL Server Management Studio (SMSS) + Power BI <br/>
    SMSS was utilized for data storage and analysis to accurately determine the values related to the Pizza Sales Dataset problem statement. Subsequently, Power BI was employed to construct a visualization model.

  <li><a href="https://geraldsimanullang.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1-Visualization-and-Analysis-of-an-Online-Retail-Invoices-Dataset/" target="_blank">Visualization and Analysis of an Online Retail Invoices Dataset</a><br/>
  Tool: Jupyter Notebook<br/>
  Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis by visualizing sales data to extract insights into store performance, identify top-selling     products, and understand customer segmentation. This project was implemented using Python programming and involved the use of several libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://geraldsimanullang.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-4-Bengaluru-House-Price-Prediction/" target="_blank">Bengaluru House Price Prediction</a><br/>
      Tool: Jupyter Notebook <br/>
      Constructed models to predict house prices in Bengaluru, India. After data cleaning, method selection utilized GridSearchCV to evaluate regression performance with linear regression, lasso, and decision tree regressor. In this case, the optimal method was linear regression with a score of 81.9 out of 100.

    <li><a href="https://geraldsimanullang.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2-Image-classification-of-rock-paper-scissors-hand-shaped-pictures/" target="_blank">Image Classification of Rock-paper-scissors Hand-shaped Pictures</a><br/>
    Tool: Google Colab<br/>
    Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) machine learning model with an accuracy >96% for classifying images of rock-paper-scissors hand-shaped pictures using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries
