Hi there, I'm Gerald! üëãüèª Welcome to my personal portfolio page. üôèüèª
I'm a master's degree graduate in Industrial Engineering, specializing in Business Analytics from Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta. Below are my portfolios divided into two categories.<br/>

* The first category, named 'Data Analysis and Visualization,' consists of projects involving data analysis with Python programming or SQL and visualization with Python programming (Matplotlib+Seaborn) or Power BI.
* The second category, named 'Machine Learning,' encompasses projects that include machine learning algorithms, all of which were executed with Python programming. <br/>

<h3>Data Analysis and Visualization</h3>
Projects involving data analysis and visualization with Python programming, SQL and/or Power BI.

  <li><a href="https://geraldsimanullang.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-of-Pizza-Sales-SQL-PowerBI/" target="_blank">Data Analysis and Visualization of Pizza Sales</a><br/>
    Tools: SQL Server Management Studio (SMSS) + Power BI <br/>
    SMSS was utilized for data storage and analysis to accurately determine the values related to the Pizza Sales Dataset problem statement. Subsequently, Power BI was employed to construct a visualization model.

  Tool: Jupyter Notebook  <br/>
  Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis by visualizing sales data to extract insights into store performance, identify top-selling     products, and understand customer segmentation. This project was implemented using Python programming and involved the use of several libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
