Hi there, I'm Gerald! üëãüèª Welcome to my personal portfolio page. üôèüèª
I'm a master's degree graduate in Industrial Engineering, specializing in Business Analytics from Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta. Below are my portfolios divided into two categories.<br/>

* The first category, named 'Data Analysis and Visualization,' consists of projects involving data analysis with Python programming or SQL and visualization with Python programming (Matplotlib+Seaborn) or Power BI.
* The second category, named 'Machine Learning,' encompasses projects that include machine learning algorithms, all of which were executed with Python programming.

*  [**Data Analysis and Visualization of Pizza Sales**](https://geraldsimanullang.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-3-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-of-Pizza-Sales-SQL-PowerBI/)  
  **Tools**: SQL Server Management Studio (SMSS) + Power BI  
  **Description**:  
  SMSS was utilized for **data storage** and **analysis** to accurately determine the values related to the Pizza Sales Dataset problem statement. Subsequently, Power BI was employed to construct a **visualization model**.

* [**Visualization and Analysis of an Online Retail Invoices Dataset**](https://geraldsimanullang.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1-Visualization-and-Analysis-of-an-Online-Retail-Invoices-Dataset/)  
  **Tool**: Jupyter Notebook  
  **Description**:  
  Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis** by visualizing sales data to extract insights into store performance, identify top-selling     products, and understand customer segmentation. This project was implemented using Python programming and involved the use of several libraries, including **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

* [**Image Classification of Rock-paper-scissors Hand-shaped Pictures**](https://geraldsimanullang.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-2-Image-classification-of-rock-paper-scissors-hand-shaped-pictures/)  
  **Tool**: Google Colab  
  **Description**:  
  Built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** machine learning model with an **accuracy >96%** for classifying images of rock-paper-scissors hand-shaped pictures using the **TensorFlow and Keras** libraries
