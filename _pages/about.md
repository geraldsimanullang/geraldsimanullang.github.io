Hi there, I'm Gerald! üëãüèª Welcome to my personal portfolio page. üôèüèª  
Below are the projects I've done:
<br/><br/>

**Project #4**  
[**House Price Prediction in Bengaluru**](https://github.com/geraldsimanullang/Bengaluru-House-Price-Prediction/assets/154493278/8659ecf4-38ce-421e-a016-33aebda5d62f) (Python)

</p>
* Conducted outlier handling, missing value imputation, implemented one-hot encoding for categorical variables, and managed data type handling in the preprocessing stage.
* Performed and compared three regression algorithms: Linear Regression, Lasso, and Decision Tree Regressor.
* Calculated scores and searched for the best parameters for each algorithm using GridSearchCV. The result indicated that Linear Regression was the most suitable for this case with a score of 81.9%

</p>
* Built a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras libraries to classify hand gesture photos as either forming a rock, paper, or scissors
* Achieved accuracy and validation accuracy results exceeding 96%
* Utilized image augmentation techniques and callbacks, resulting in accuracy and validation accuracy surpassing **96%**
* Received a perfect score of 5 out of 5 stars from the reviewer. This is the final project for the machine learning course from Dicoding Indonesia.

</p>
* Conducted exploratory data analysis on 541,909 sales records with Pandas library
* Performed data preprocessing to address missing values, non-positive sales figures, ambiguity in product descriptions, and data type inconsistencies
* Performed visualization of monthly and daily sales trends, top selling products, and top loyal customers
* Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for visualizing monthly and daily sales trends, top-selling products, and top loyal customers
* Extracted insights and provided recommendations from the visualization results
